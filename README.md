# Linux Image Template Repo

## Building with GitHub Codespaces

To build with GitHub Codespaces, first create a repository based on this template repo.

Create the repo in your own user account and give it a name.
Make the repo public.

Open a new codespace in that repo.

Run the `build-codespace` script like this:

`./build-codespace base`

This will call the `build` script with a few codespace specific additions.

It will take a few minutes and produce a lot of output.
